# Write a program that adds the digits in a 2 digit number.
# e.g. if the input was 35, then the output should be 3 + 5 = 8
# Warning. Do not change the code on lines 1-3. Your program should 
# work for different inputs. e.g. any two-digit number.

num = input('Please enter a two digit number: ')
#num0 = int(num[0])
#num1 = int(num[1])

print(int(num[0]) + int(num[1]))
